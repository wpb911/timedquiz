# Timed Coding Quiz Challenge 

This is a project that required developing a timed quiz that allowed the score to be saved when the user completed the quiz. The score is based on the number of seconds left when the quiz is completed. 

## Enhancements
The objective was to show the questions and determine if the user chose the correct answer or not when presented with the questions. Event handlers were used with event delegation on the List for each of its elements. The name attribute was used to determine which element had been selected and the determination could then be made from the question object as the correct answer was stored as part of the object along with the questions and text of the answers.
