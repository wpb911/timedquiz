# Timed Coding Quiz Challenge 

This is a project that required developing a timed quiz that allowed the score to be saved when the user completed the quiz. The score is based on the number of seconds left when the quiz is completed. 

## Enhancements
The objective was to show the questions and determine if the user chose the correct answer or not when presented with the questions. The quiz is timed with the time remaining showing as the quiz is taken.  Ten seconds are removed from the time remaining for every incorrect answer. Event handlers were used with event delegation on a list. The name attribute was used to determine which element had been selected and the determination could then be made from the question object as the correct answer was stored as part of the object along with the questions and text of the answers.  

The coding was completed up to calculating the total score. Future enhancements would complete the ability to save the score for future retrieval and display the highscore.
